    // shorter lifetime. The capsule would still have access to the memory after
    // the buffer is deallocated and the memory re-used (e.g. if the buffer is
    // on the stack), likely leaking data the process binary does not want to
    // share. Therefore, AllowRo cannot be covariant with respect to 'share.
    // Contravariance would not have this issue, but would still be confusing
    // and would be unexpected.

    // Additionally, this makes AllowRo !Sync, which is probably desirable, as
