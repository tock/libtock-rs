    // shorter lifetime. The capsule would still have access to the memory after
    // the buffer is deallocated and the memory re-used (e.g. if the buffer is
    // on the stack), allowing it to cause undefined behavior in the process.

    // Contravariance would not have this issue, but would still be confusing
    // and would be unexpected.

    // Additionally, this makes AllowRw !Sync, which is probably desirable, as
    // Sync would allow for races between threads sharing buffers with the
    // kernel.
