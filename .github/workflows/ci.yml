    # Using ubuntu-latest can cause breakage when ubuntu-latest is updated to
    # point at a new Ubuntu version. Instead, explicitly specify the version, so
    # we can update when we need to. This *could* break if we don't update it
    # until support for this version is dropped, but it is likely we'll have a
    # reason to update to a newer Ubuntu before then anyway.

      # makefile can be tested locally. We experimentally determined that -j2 is

      # GitHub Actions at the time of this writing.

      # We have to append the "-D warnings" flag to .cargo/config.toml rather

      # RUSTFLAGS cargo will ignore the rustflags config in .cargo/config,
      # breaking relocation.
