//! This sample demonstrates setting up the i2c ip (assuming board has support)
//! for target mode. In the event loop, we first expect the master to write some data
//! then we setup a response packet.
//!
//! NOTE: The device (based on hwip) may stretch clocks by holding the SCL line low if the master attempts to
//! read data before we have setup the read data buffers.
//!
//! This sample is tested with `i2c_master_write_read.rs` sample running on the
//! master device.
