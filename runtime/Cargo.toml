[features]

# By default, libtock_runtime calls Memop to tell the Tock kernel where the
# stack and heap begin. The kernel uses those addresses to specify the stack and
# heap address ranges if the process faults. Those calls cost 22 bytes on ARM
# and 28 bytes on RISC-V. To remove them (for the purpose of minimizing code
# size), enable the no_debug_memop feature.
