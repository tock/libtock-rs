# libtock-rs

Rust userland library for Tock

Generally this library was tested with Tock [Release
2.1.1](https://github.com/tock/tock/releases/tag/release-2.1.1).

The library should work on all Tock boards, but currently apps must be compiled
for the flash and RAM address they are executed at. See [Fix
relocation](https://github.com/tock/libtock-rs/issues/28) for more details. You
may either compile a process binary especially for your board and use only a
single application written in rust at a time, or use the `make tab` target that
builds examples for a series of likely useful flash and RAM addresses.

## Getting Started

1.  Ensure you have [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/) installed.

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/tock/libtock-rs
    cd libtock-rs
    ```

1.  Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    make setup
    ```

1.  Use `make` to build examples

    ```shell
    make nrf52 EXAMPLE=console # Builds the console example for the nrf52
    ```

## Using libtock-rs

The easiest way to start using libtock-rs is adding an example to the
`examples/` folder. We recommend starting by copying the `console` example, as
it is a simple example that shows you how to perform normal debug prints.

### Building for a specific board

To build your example for your board you can use

```shell
make <platform> EXAMPLE=<example>
```

An example can be flashed to your board after the build process by running:

```shell
make flash-<platform> EXAMPLE=<example>
```

This script does the following steps for you:

- cross-compile your program
- create a TAB (tock application bundle)
- if you have a J-Link compatible board connected: flash this TAB to your board (using tockloader)

### Building a generic TAB (Tock Application Bundle) file

To build your example for a variety of boards you can use

```shell
make tab EXAMPLE=<example>
```

To install the tab use tockloader

```shell
tockloader install <example.tab>
```

Tockloader will determine which compiled version with the correct flash and RAM
addresses to use.
